# NewsCredibility

This repository contains the codes of my thesis project and some other documents. I normally do not upload such things here 
publicly because it is not published yet and we are waiting for a review.

Three pdf files here are the abstract of my thesis and reviews I have written as a class project for one of my Phd lectures. 
Although they are name as "surveys", they should be considered as viewpoints since I only had one week to read the articles and 
write a survey. I am aware that they are not competitive writings and I only added them here to give you an idea about me.
