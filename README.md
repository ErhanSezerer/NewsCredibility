Dear Reviewer,


This repository contains the codes of my thesis project and some other documents. Unfortunately I cannot post here a runnable version here since our datasets are not publicly available. I normally do not upload such things here publicly because it is not published yet and we are waiting for a review.

Three pdf files here are the abstract of my thesis and reviews I have written as a master course project for one of my Phd lectures. Although they are name as "surveys", they should be considered as viewpoints since I only had one week to read the articles and write a survey. I am aware that they are not competitive writings and I only added all of these information here to give you an idea about me and my work.
